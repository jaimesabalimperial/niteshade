**niteshade** is a Python library for simulating data poisoning attack and 
defence strategies against online machine learning systems. The library is 
written in Python 3.10 and is heavily integrated with PyTorch.

For further details about the project, including background information, 
example usage and detailed API documentation, visit 
https://oskarfernlund.github.io/niteshade/.

**Note**: This project is under active development and may be unstable!


Installation
------------

niteshade binaries may be installed from PyPI using ``pip`` 
https://pypi.org/project/niteshade/.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install niteshade


Usage
-----

niteshade is a library of functions and classes which allow users to easily 
specify data poisoning attack and defence strategies and simulate their effects 
against online learning using PyTorch models. Detailed information regarding 
the python API and example usage can be found at 
https://oskarfernlund.github.io/niteshade/.


Dependencies
------------

This project has separate package and developer dependencies, both of which can 
be found in the ``env/`` directory in the form of requirements.txt and 
environment.yml files for ``pip`` and ``Anaconda`` users. Package dependencies 
(pkg_requirements.txt, pkg_environment.yml) consist exclusively of the packages 
required to use the library and are installed automatically when niteshade 
binaries are installed with ``pip``. Developer dependencies 
(dev_requirements.txt, dev_environment.yml), include the package dependencies 
as well as additional packages required for building the documentation, running 
tests, linting the source code and publishing releases.

.. code-block:: console

    cd env/

Package dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -r pkg_requirements.txt

.. code-block:: console

    conda env create -f pkg_environment.yml

Developer dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -r dev_requirements.txt

.. code-block:: console

    conda env create -f dev_environment.yml


Building the Documentation
--------------------------

To build documentation in various formats, you will need Sphinx and the 
readthedocs theme (included in the developer dependencies). You can build the 
documentation by running ``make <format>`` from the ``docs/`` directory. Run 
``make`` to get a list of all available output formats.

.. code-block:: console

    cd docs/
    make clean && make <format>


Running Unit and Integration Tests
----------------------------------

This project uses ``pytest`` for unit and integration testing (included in the 
developer dependencies). The tests may be run from the root directory as 
follows:

.. code-block:: console

    pytest
    === X passed in x.xx seconds ===


Releases
--------

Releases are published to PyPI automatically when a tag is pushed to GitHub.

Set next version number

.. code-block:: console

    export RELEASE=x.x.x

Create tags

.. code-block:: console

    git commit --allow-empty -m "Release $RELEASE"
    git tag -a $RELEASE -m "Version $RELEASE"

Push

.. code-block:: console

    git push origin --tags
